# dd-sdk-reactnative-examples

The goal of this repository is to show implementations of the [Datadog React Native SDK][1].

These implementations use [react-navigation][2] to navigate between screens.

The repository presents the following use cases:

1. General case with the [`rum-react-navigation`](rum-react-navigation) app
1. With codepush with the [`rum-react-navigation-codepush`](rum-react-navigation-codepush) app
1. Initializing the SDK asynchronously with the [`rum-react-navigation-async`](rum-react-navigation-async) app
1. In an Expo application with the [`rum-expo-react-navigation`](rum-expo-react-navigation) app
1. In hybrid apps with the:

   a. [`android-app-with-rn`](android-app-with-rn) app (android app with RN screens)

   b. [`ios-app-with-rn`](ios-app-with-rn) app (iOS app with RN screens)

   c. [`rn-app-with-native`](rn-app-with-native) app (RN app with native screens)
