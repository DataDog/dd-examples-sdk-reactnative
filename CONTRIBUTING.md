# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR or open an Issue.

## Setup your developer Environment

To get started with the project, follow the installation instructions in each app.

### Project structure overview

The sample application is for shopping furniture and retrieves its resources from [shopist](https://shopist.io) - except for the hybrid applications.

It contains the following pages:

1. Login Page

   - You can use any username but for the password use '1234' for all projects except `codepush` that has a password of '12345'

2. Categories page

   - On the top right, there's a button used to crash the app and test the wizard
   - Click on a category to go the corresponding products

3. Products page

   - Choose the products you want to add to your list
   - You can add each product only once
   - You can add products from different categories

4. Cart's page

   - You can find here the list of products you've created

You can use any username for the login page but for the password use '1234' for all projects except `codepush` that has a password of '12345'

If you are using Visual Studio Code, please make sure to set workspace version of TypeScript instead of the native Typescript bundled with Visual Studio, check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39676463/3222695) to see how to do it.

### Running the apps

You can then run the individual apps using the following commands

```sh
# Run the Android sample
yarn android

# Run the ios sample
yarn ios
```

## Submitting Issues

## Have a patch?

We welcome code contributions to the library, which you can
[submit as a pull request](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-reactnative-examples/pull/new/master).
Before you submit a PR, make sure that you first create an Issue to explain the
bug or the feature your patch covers, and make sure another Issue or PR doesn't
already exist.

To create a pull request:

1. **Fork the repository** from <https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-reactnative-examples> ;
2. **Make any changes** for your patch;
3. **Write tests** that demonstrate how the feature works or how the bug is fixed;
4. **Update any documentation** especially for
   new features;
5. **Submit the pull request** from your fork back to this
   [repository](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-reactnative-examples) .

The pull request will be run through our CI pipeline, and a project member will
review the changes with you. At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, pull
requests must:

- Have a stated goal and detailed description of the changes made;
- Include thorough test coverage and documentation, where applicable;
- Receive at least one approval from a project member with push permissions.

Make sure that your code is clean and readable, that your commits are small and
atomic, with a proper commit message.
